# Rahul Sandhu's Arch Linux Install Guide
A guide for how I like to setup Arch Linux
## Requirements
1) USB Flash Drive 4Gb or more
2) An x86-64 or i686 based PC
3) Basic Terminal Knowledge
4) Some time and patience
## Creating a bootable USB
First, go to archlinux.org/download/, scroll down to HTTP Direct Downloads, and choose a mirror server thats closest to your location. Then, right click on the file name archlinux-yyyy.mm.dd-x86_64.iso, and click copy link. Next, enter a terminal and type 'wget' followed by pasting the link you copied. If you are on Windows or macOS, you can download a tool called balenaEtcher to create the bootable USB.
